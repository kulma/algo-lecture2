# Activities

## Task 1

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Why is Algorithm Analysis Important?
> Algorithm analysis can tell important things about the efficiency, scalability and performance of the algoritm.

- Explain the Big $O$ notation
> from Wikipedia: In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

- Compare `Linear`, `Logarithmic`, `Quadratic` and `Constant` complexities.

> Quadratic function O(nÂ²) is inefficient 
> Linear O(n) is ok
> Logarithmic O(log(n)) is good
> Constant O(c) is excellent

## Task2

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple algorithm in C++ that finds the square of the first item in a list and then prints it on the screen.


- What is the complexity of the algorithm?


## Task 3

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple program that displays all items in a list to the console.


- What is the complexity of the algorithm?


## Task 4: : Individual, at home

Refer to this [pdf](./big_o.pdf):

- What is the difference between complexity and performance:


- Does complexity affects performance bor is it the other way around?


- Restate the formal definition of big $O$ in plain English
